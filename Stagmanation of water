Water stagnation in Chennai is a common problem during the monsoon season due to the city's flat terrain and tidal effects. [1]  
Causes [1]  

Flat terrain 

Chennai's average land level is only 2 meters above sea level. [1]  

Tidal effects 

The city's low elevation makes it susceptible to flooding and water stagnation during high tides. [1]  

Lack of planning 

Some say that the city's stormwater drains and pumping stations are not prepared to handle heavy rains. [2]  

Garbage 

Open dumping of food waste, plastic, and debris can block stormwater drains. [2]  

Water hyacinth 

Water hyacinth can choke culverts and cause water to accumulate in low-lying areas. [3]  


Effects [1]  

• Flooding: Water stagnation can lead to flooding in low-lying areas. [1]  
• Sewage overflow: Sewage can mix with drinking water, increasing public health risks. [4]  
• Transport disruptions: Water stagnation can cause transport disruptions. [5]  

Solutions [1]  

• Stormwater drainage system: An effective stormwater drainage system can help prevent water stagnation. [1]  
• Regular maintenance: Regular maintenance of stormwater drains and pumping stations can help prevent water stagnation. [2]  
• Cleanliness: Regular cleaning of stormwater drains and removal of garbage can help prevent water stagnation. [2]
