Overview :

In the past five years, Chennai has seen a significant impact from climate change, primarily characterized by rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns with intense bursts during monsoon season, and a decrease in the number of rainy days, leading to increased water scarcity and vulnerability to flooding due to poor drainage infrastructure, exacerbated by rapid urbanization; the city's suburbs are also experiencing a noticeable warming trend. 

Key points about climate change in Chennai over the past 5 years: 

• Increased heat waves: 
Average temperatures have risen, with more days experiencing extreme heat, particularly during summer months. 

• Erratic rainfall: 
While the overall rainfall might not have significantly reduced, the pattern has become unpredictable, with heavy downpours concentrated in short periods during monsoon, leading to flooding.

• Reduced rainy days: 
The number of days with rain has decreased, contributing to water scarcity issues.

• Urbanization impact: Rapid development has further aggravated the problem by reducing green spaces and natural water retention areas, leading to increased run off during heavy rain.

• Coastal vulnerability: Rising sea levels pose a threat to coastal areas in Chennai, potentially impacting shoreline erosion.
