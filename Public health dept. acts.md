# Vector control of measures

  # Introduction :

                The Vector Control Department of Greater Chennai Corporation comprises of three wings, mosquito viz., Menace Control. Vector - borne Diseases Control and Zoontic Diseases Control.  The first wing monitors aquatic habitats which are the primary breeding sources of mosquitoes, especially Culex species.  The next wing screens the public community for major mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, filariasis and Japanese Encephalitis. The last wing keeps the rodents under checks as they responsible for the outbreak of leptospirosis and scrub typhus.

    Control of Mosquitoes and Mosquito-Borne Diseases :

    Chennai city is encountering twin problem of mosquito menace and mosquito borne diseases like malaria, dengue and filariasis.

    Between these two public health issues, the problem of mosquito menace is realized more by the people of Chennai than the diseases. 

    The chief sources for mosquito menace in Chennai are waterways and storm water drains. There is a total of 247.09kms length of major and minor waterways crisscrossly flowing within the city limits. In addition to this, there is a total of about 2062.94kms length network of storm water drains in the city. On account of certain inherent problem these sources have become highly mosquitogenic.

  # Mosquito Menace :

    Mosquitoes are distributed worldwide in tropical regions with hot and humid climate and they belong to the order Diptera, suborder Nematocera and Family Culicidae, arranged under three sub-families namely Anophelinae,Culicinae and Toxorhynchitinae.

    The mosquito fauna in Chennai consists of three vectors, viz., Anopheles (Malaria), Aedes (Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika) and Culex (Filariasis and Japanese Encephalitis), while the first two vectors breeds in clean water, the latter breeds in polluted water.

    Water ways and canals actas a potential breeding sources for Culexquinquefasciatus which is also called the nuisance/menace mosquito.

    Of the three major vectors, Aedes is responsible for the transmission of Dengue, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever, Dengue Shock Syndrome, Zika Virus Fever and Yellow Fever, whereas Anopheles for Malaria. Culex species are involved in the transmission of Filariasis and Japanese Encephalitis.

    It is vital to understand the distribution of vector-borne diseases, about transmission and their vectors in order to plan control and prioritise resources since disease endemicity are determined by factors, viz., pathogen, vector, human and environmental conditions.

    Control measures are aimed at both immature and adult stages of the mosquitoes. For immature control, effective anti-larval measures are adopted.

    Elimination of breeding sources, environmental management, larvicide treatment are some of the ways used for immature control.

    For control of adult mosquitoes, indoor residual spray and space spray are mainly followed. The breeding water sources are treated, covered up or drained as it is the most effective method.

  #Malaria :

    Malaria in India is mainly caused by two major malaria parasites namely plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum( though cases of malaria from plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malariae have also been reported from some parts of the country ) Plasmodium vivax ( Pv)  and Plasmodium Falciparum (PF) are the most common species causing malaria in the country. While Plasmodium vivax ( Pv)  is more prevalent in the plains, Plasmodium Falciparum (PF) predominates in forested and peripheral areas.

    Malaria is transmitted by a female Anopheles mosquito bite which has been infected through a blood meal taken from an infected person. A single infected vector, during her lifetime, may infect several persons. Afterabout a week of taking infected blood meal mosquito is able to transmit malaria. This is known as vector transmission. The malaria parasite undergoes 2 cycles of development the human cycle (Asexual cycle ) and the mosquito cycle  ( Sexual cycle). Human is the intermediate host and mosquito the definitive host.

  # Anopheles Stephensi is a major vector species for malaria in Chennai.

# Dengue :

    Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease with 2.5 billion people living in area of risk and tens millions cases occurring in each year, affecting more than 100 countries.  It is one of the most rapidly emerging mosquitos borne disease in the world and W.H.O has identified dengue as a re-emerging disease in South East Asia.

    Dengue virus was first isolated in India during 1945. There are three forms of disease.   1) Dengue fever (DF) 2 Dengue Hemorrhagic fever and 3) Dengue shock syndrome (DSS).  Nearly 44% of DHF and DSS can be fatal/ there are four serotypes namely DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 & DENV-4.

    In 1995, DHF became a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in many Asian countries. In India the first outbreak of DHF/DSS was documented in Delhi 1985. But prior to this endemic transmission of all for dengue serotypes has been reported.

    Aedes aegypti / Aedes albopictus is the main vector mosquito responsible for transmission of dengue. This mosquito has characteristic white stripes on the back and legs. Hence, it is also called as Tiger mosquito. The mosquito breeds indoors in closets, fridges, aquatic, ornamental plants kept in water. The mosquito rests indoors in closets and other dark places. Outside they rest where it is cool and shady. The female mosquito lays eggs in clean water containers and around the houses. This mosquito is a domestic breeder and breeding can occur in any water catching or water storage container such as wells, overhead-tanks discarded items tyres, utensils and large containers used for rain water collection which are not emptied and cleaned periodically. Since, water is essential during the first 8 days in the life of the mosquito, emptying containers once a week will greatly reduce the risk of dengue fever. Aedes mosquito can fly upto a limited distance of 400 meters (usually not more than 100 meters) but can spread over vast distances mechanically in various types of vehicles used by man.

# Japanese Encephalitis :

    Disease situation: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral disease of major public health importance in India because of its epidemic potential, high case fatality rate and presence of life – long complications in survivors. It is a single – stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus flavivirus. Disease in prevalent in most of south central, northern and northeast states of India, predominantly in rural areas, although some urban areas also report cases. JE is a paediatric problem affecting mainly 1- 15 years olds. However, in areas where JE has not been reported earlier, all age groups may be affected during an outbreak due to lack of immunity.

    In areas at risk, Japanese encephalitis is primarily a disease of children, but it can occur in a person of any age. JE Virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culexvishnui group of mosquitoes, particularly Culextritaeniorhynchus. The main reservoirs of the JE virus are pigs and water birds, and in its natural cycle, virus is maintained in these animals. Man is an accidental host and does not play a role in JE transmission. After   9-12 days (extrinsic incubation period) mosquitoes transmit disease to other vertebrate hosts. Epidemics occur during monsoon and post monsoon period because the vector density is high. However, in endemic areas, sporadic cases may occur throughout the year.

# Leptospirosis :

    Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of world – wide distribution.  The spectrum its clinical presentation and the tedious laboratory procedure required for its confirmatory diagnosis has made its recognition difficult in most of the instances and consequently it is grossly under-reported.  Though it is considered as an occupational hazard in many countries, the environment and life style of people of the developing countries put the whole population of such countries at risk of acquiring leptospiral infection.  The bacteria-Leptospira was identified in 1915 and its association between Weil’s disease and many other clinical syndromes like Seven Day Fever, Canicola Fever etc.  Has been known for the past many decades.  Though the disease has a worldwide distribution, surveillance against it is restricted to a few countries.

    During the first few decades of this century, the disease had been reported from many parts of the country based purely on clinical suspicion.  Bacteriological confirmation of the presence of human leptospiral infection in the country was first reported from Andaman Islands in 1929.  Later, it was reported from other places like Bombay, Calcutta and Assam.  All these were isolated reports from localised areas.

    Since leptospirosis presents in a wide variety of clinical forms, identification of suspects on clinical grounds is not possible in many instances.  The association between Weil’s disease and leptospirosis is so strong in the minds of etiology is never suspected.  This leads to a significant proportion of the cases going unnoticed.  Hence the necessity to formulate a broad-based clinical definition was felt by delegates and the following case definition was agreed upon.  

# Scrub typhus :

    Scrub typhus, first described in Japan in 1899, caused by Orientiatsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia), is an acute infectious disease of variable severity that is transmitted to humans by an arthropod vector of the Trombiculidae family. It affects people of all ages including children. Humans are accidental hosts in this zoonotic disease. While scrub typhus is confined geographically to the Asia Pacific region, a billion people are at risk and nearly a million cases are reported every year.

    The infection is transmitted to human and rodents by some species of infective trombiculid mites (“Chiggers,” L. deliense, and others), feeds on lymph and tissue fluid rather than blood. Once they are infected in nature by feeding on the body fluid of small mammals, including the rodents, they maintain the infection throughout their life stages and as adults, pass the infection on to their eggs in a process called transovarial transmission.

    To break the mite life cycle, the home and the pets should be treated as well as the outside surroundings of the house. Control of mites outdoors requires more than one application of insecticides and the pets require several treatment.

# AYUSH Clinics

The Greater Chennai Corporation has opened 3 AYUSH clinics (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) in Zone 4, 10 and 13 (location of clinic) to provide five alternative Indian system of medicines.

# A. Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme

The RNTCP is run by the Chennai Corporation since 1999. Presently 36 TB Units and 70 Designated Microscopic Centre (DMC) functioning in the RNTCP. The number of patients registered for treatment has increased from 7000 to 8000 per year. All TB patients are registered and given free DOTS treatment for 6-8 months in all the UPHCs of Chennai Corporation. During the year 2016, the number of individuals tested for TB was 74,782, out of which 7990 patients were diagnosed with TB and treatment given. The treatment success rate is 80%.

Presently sputum AFB is done in all 138 UPHCs. DOTS treatment and MDR treatment is available in all centres. Patients are given proper counseling by Health Visitor (HV), Senior TB Treatment Supervisor (STS) and adherence monitored. Whenever patient does not come for taking treatment, the staff go to their residence and counsel him/her on the need for regular treatment and retrieve them. Sputum microscopy being the backbone of the Programme, the Lab Technicians are well trained by the Programme. The STLS do the rechecking of the slides regularly thus maintaining the effectiveness of the programme. For the People Living with HIV(PLHIV) Fixed Drug Combination(FDC) has been implemented in all five ART centres, the adherence of the patient is being monitored through 99DOTS software. Isoniazid Prophylaxis Therapy (IPT) will be started for the PLHIV not having TB. Chennai is one of the few sites for implementing the new drug Tab.Bedaquiline for MDR patients.

From the year 2013 onwards, free breakfast from Amma Unavagam was issued for TB patients for one year. The facilities for detecting MDR TB patients were improved. Presently the time taken for detection is only 2 hours by CBNAAT (GeneXpert) machine as against 2 months by solid culture. Such MDR TB patients are given a cash incentive of Rs.1000/- per month to support their financial needs.

To improve the notification from Private Sector, New Coordinator posts was created in the year 2016. To reduce the Pre-Treatment Lost to follow ups CUG numbers were given to all RNTCP staff to reduce the gap in communicating the referral status and initiating the treatment of the patient. As a part of intensified control activities a active case finding camp was conducted for six days in Tsunami quarters, Ernavoor and five patients were identified and they are under treatment. It is further planned to conduct weekly camp on all Saturdays in all slums covering all 15 zones.

Further, Greater Chennai Corporation has entered into a MOU with USAID and STOP TB partnership to intensify the TB control activities in the city. These international agencies will be supplying 10 GeneXpert machines to improve the case detection. Moreover, the Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to procure 7 Mobile Medical Units to do active case finding in vulnerable population. All these activities will help in achieving the goal of a “TB Free Chennai”.]\
